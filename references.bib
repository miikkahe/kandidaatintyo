abstract = {1. Scope 1.1 This test method covers laboratory procedures for determining the resistance of metallic materials to scratching abrasion by means of the dry sand/rubber wheel test. It is the intent of this test method to produce data that will reproducibly rank materials in their resistance to scratching abrasion under a specified set of conditions. 1.2 Abrasion test results are reported as volume loss in cubic millimetres for the particular test procedure specified. Materials of higher abrasion resistance will have a lower volume loss. Note 1-In order to attain uniformity among laboratories, it is the intent of this test method to require that volume loss due to abrasion be reported only in the metric system as cubic millimetres. 1 mm3 = 6.102 X 10-5in3. 1.3 This test method covers four recommended procedures which are appropriate for specific degrees of wear resistance or thicknesses of the test material. 1.3.1 Procedure A -This is a relatively severe test which will rank metallic materials on a wide volume loss scale from low to extreme abrasion resistance. It is particularly useful in ranking materials of medium to extreme abrasion resistance. 1.3.2 Procedure B -A short-term variation of Procedure A. It may be used for highly abrasive resistant materials but is particularly useful in the ranking of medium- and low-abrasive-resistant materials. Procedure B should be used when the volume-loss values developed by Procedure A exceeds 100 mm3. 1.3.3 Procedure C -A short-term variation of Procedure A for use on thin coatings. 1.3.4 Procedure D -This is a lighter load variation of Procedure A which is particularly useful in ranking materials of low-abrasion resistance. It is also used in ranking materials of a specific generic type or materials which would be very close in the volume loss rates as developed by Procedure A. 1.3.5 Procedure E -A short-term variation of Procedure B that is useful in the ranking of materials with medium- or low-abrasion resistance. 1.4 This standard does not purport to address the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use. 2.

abstract = {Taguchi Method is a statistical approach to optimize the process parameters and improve the quality of components that are manufactured. The objective of this study is to illustrate the procedure adopted in using Taguchi Method to a lathe facing operation. The orthogonal array, signal-to-noise ratio, and the analysis of variance are employed to study the performance characteristics on facing operation. In this analysis, three factors namely speed; feed and depth of cut were considered. Accordingly, a suitable orthogonal array was selected and experiments were conducted. After conducting the experiments the surface roughness was measured and Signal to Noise ratio was calculated. With the help of graphs, optimum parameter values were obtained and the confirmation experiments were carried out. These results were compared with the results of full factorial method.},

@book{Box2005,
abstract = {Rewritten and updated, this new edition of Statistics for Experimenters adopts the same approaches as the landmark First Edition by teaching with examples, readily understood graphics, and the appropriate use of computers. Catalyzing innovation, problem solving, and discovery, the Second Edition provides experimenters with the scientific and statistical tools needed to maximize the knowledge gained from research data, illustrating how these tools may best be utilized during all stages of the investigative process. The authors’ practical approach starts with a problem that needs to be solved and then examines the appropriate statistical methods of design and analysis. Providing even greater accessibility for its users, the Second Edition is thoroughly revised and updated to reflect the changes in techniques and technologies since the publication of the classic First Edition. Among the new topics included are: Graphical Analysis of Variance Computer Analysis of Complex Designs Simplification by transformation Hands-on experimentation using Response Service Methods Further development of robust product and process design using split plot arrangements and minimization of error transmission Introduction to Process Control, Forecasting and Time Series Illustrations demonstrating how multi-response problems can be solved using the concepts of active and inert factor spaces and canonical spaces Bayesian approaches to model selection and sequential experimentation An appendix featuring Quaquaversal quotes from a variety of sources including noted statisticians and scientists to famous philosophers is provided to illustrate key concepts and enliven the learning process. All the computations in the Second Edition can be done utilizing the statistical language R. Functions for displaying ANOVA and lamba plots, Bayesian screening, and model building are all included and R packages are available online. All theses topics can also be applied utilizing easy-to-use commercial software packages. Complete with applications covering the physical, engineering, biological, and social sciences, Statistics for Experimenters is designed for individuals who must use statistical approaches to conduct an experiment, but do not necessarily have formal training in statistics. Experimenters need only a basic understanding of mathematics to master all the statistical methods presented. This text is an essential reference for all researchers and is a highly recommended course book for undergraduate and graduate students.},

@article{Cox2006,
abstract = {This guide provides best practice in the evaluation of uncertainty within metrology, and in the support to this topic given by statistical modelling. It is motivated by two principle considerations. The first is that although the primary guide on uncertainty evaluation, the ‘Guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement’ (GUM), published by ISO, can be expected to be very widely applicable, the approach it predominantly endorses contains some limitations. The other is that on the basis of the authors’ considerable contact with practitioners in the metrology community it is evident that important classes of problem are encountered that are subject to these limitations. A further consideration is that measure- ment models are encountered in practice that lie outside the scope of the model type (viz., univariate, explicit and real) that is the focus of the presentation given in the GUM. Central to consideration is the need to carry out uncertainty evaluation in as scientific a manner as economically possible. Although several approaches to uncertainty evaluation exist, the GUM has been very widely adopted (and is strongly supported by the authors of the current guide). The emphasis of this guide is on making good use of the GUM, on aspects that yield greater generality, and especially on the provision in some cases of mea- surement uncertainties that are more objectively based and numerically more sustainable. The guide is also concerned with validating the current usage of the GUM in circumstances where there is doubt concerning its applicability. The relationship of this guide to the work being carried out by the Joint Committee on Guides in Metrology to prepare Supplements to the GUM is indicated.},

abstract = {An integrated approach for estimation and reduction of measurement variation (and its components) through a single parameter design experiment is developed. Systems with a linear signal-response relationship are considered. The noise factors are classified into a few distinct categories based on their impact on the measurement system. A random coefficients model that accounts for the effect of control factors and each category of noise factors on the signal- response relationship is proposed. A suitable performance measure is developed using this general model, and conditions under which it reduces to the usual dynamic signal-to-noise (SN) ratio are discussed. Two different data analysis strategies – response function modeling (RFM) and performance measure modeling (PMM) – for modeling and optimization are proposed and compared. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated with a simulation study and Taguchi’s drive shaft experiment.},

abstract = {Measurement-based admission control (MBAC) is an attractive
mechanism to concurrently offer quality of service (QoS) to users,
without requiring a priori traffic specification and on-line policing.
However, several aspects of such a system need to be dearly understood
in order to devise robust MBAC schemes, i.e., schemes that can match a
given QoS target despite the inherent measurement uncertainty, and
without the tuning of external system parameters. We study the impact of
measurement uncertainty, flow arrival, departure dynamics, and of
estimation memory on the performance of a generic MBAC system in a
common analytical framework. We show that a certainty equivalence
assumption, i.e., assuming that the measured parameters are the real
ones, can grossly compromise the target performance of the system. We
quantify the improvement in performance as a function of the length of
the estimation window and an adjustment of the target QoS. We
demonstrate the existence of a critical time scale over which the impact
of admission decisions persists. Our results yield new insights into the
performance of MBAC schemes, and represent quantitative and qualitative
guidelines for the design of robust schemes},

@article{Hijar-Rivera2009,
abstract = {In his idea of robust parameter design , Taguchi proposes modeling the controllable factors of interest in a process along with the uncontrollable or noise factors with the goal of finding settings of the control factors that are robust to noise variability. Taguchi methodology has generated both extraordinary interest due to numerous successful applications, and much debate due to some limitations such as experimental designs with an excessive number of runs. Consequently, practitioners of response surface methodology have suggested the use of combined array designs to overcome the limitations of Taguchi's approach. An example of a combined array design that has been successfully applied as an alternative to Taguchi's designs is the composite mixed resolution (CMR) design. Most CMR designs are, in terms of design size, superior to or competitive with the corresponding Taguchi's design. However, for those cases where the number of runs required by the CMR designs is greater or equal to Taguchi's designs, it is desirable to have available an alternative experimental design. The purpose of this research is to find alternative combined arrays designs for the cases involving six to twelve variables where CMR designs are not smaller than Taguchi's designs. The original contributions of this research are the following: (1) The development of mathematical expressions to evaluate the efficiencies of combined array designs. (2) The development of design generators to obtain modified small composite designs. (3) The development of combined arrays designs with the same size as CMR designs and with higher or comparable efficiency to estimate the effects of the control and noise factors. (4) The development of combined array designs smaller than CMR designs and with the same efficiency.},

The coverage of these stages is organized in three parts that describe the evolution of RSM since its introduction in the early 1950s. Part I covers the period, 1951–1975, during which the so-called classical RSM was developed. This includes a review of basic experimental designs for fitting linear response surface models, in addition to a description of methods for the determination of optimum operating conditions. Part II, which covers the period, 1976–1999, discusses more recent modeling techniques in RSM, in addition to a coverage of Taguchi's robust parameter design and its response surface alternative approach. Part III provides a coverage of further extensions and research directions in modern RSM. This includes discussions concerning response surface models with random effects, generalized linear models, and graphical techniques for comparing response surface designs.

abstract = {The paper reports a robust parameter design experiment, where we have used Taguchi's product array and a combined array simultaneously. This was done as part of a research project dealing with experimental design to optimise the process of sheet metal spinning. We found that the classical analysis of the product array identified a control factor, which has an influence on the variance of the response. There were no indications of this effect in the combined array. A confirmation experiment supports the finding that this factor in fact is a control factor. It seems that its effect on the variance is due to several two- and three-factor interactions that were not large enough to be found in the combined array. In the authors' opinion this shows that the use of a product array and the classical analysis provides robustness against imprecise model assumptions.},

abstract = {The uncertainty of measurements must be quantified and considered in order to prove conformance with specifications and make other meaningful comparisons based on measurements. While there is a consistent methodology for the evaluation and expression of uncertainty within the metrology community industry frequently uses the alternative Measurement Systems Analysis methodology. This paper sets out to clarify the differences between uncertainty evaluation and MSA and presents a novel hybrid methodology for industrial measurement which enables a correct evaluation of measurement uncertainty while utilising the practical tools of MSA. In particular the use of Gage R\&R ANOVA and Attribute Gage studies within a wider uncertainty evaluation framework is described. This enables in-line measurement data to be used to establish repeatability and reproducibility, without time consuming repeatability studies being carried out, while maintaining a complete consideration of all sources of uncertainty and therefore enabling conformance to be proven with a stated level of confidence. Such a rigorous approach to product verification will become increasingly important in the era of the Light Controlled Factory with metrology acting as the driving force to achieve the right first time and highly automated manufacture of high value large scale products such as aircraft, spacecraft and renewable power generation structures.},

 abstract = {It is more than a decade since Genichi Taguchi's ideas on quality improvement were introduced in the United States. His parameter-design approach for reducing variation in products and processes has generated a great deal of interest among both quality practitioners and statisticians. The statistical techniques used by Taguchi to implement parameter design have been the subject of much debate, however, and there has been considerable research aimed at integrating the parameter-design principles with well-established statistical techniques. On the other hand, Taguchi and his colleagues feel that these research efforts by statisticians are misguided and reflect a lack of understanding of the engineering principles underlying Taguchi's methodology. This panel discussion provides a forum for a technical discussion of these diverse views. A group of practitioners and researchers discuss the role of parameter design and Taguchi's methodology for implementing it. The topics covered include the importance of variation reduction, the use of noise factors, the role of interactions, selection of quality characteristics, signal-to-noise ratios, experimental strategy, dynamic systems, and applications. The discussion also provides an up-to-date overview of recent research on alternative methods of design and analysis.},

@article{Stevenson1996,
abstract = {A rubber wheel abrasion tester with some advantages over the design described in ASTM G65 has been designed and characterised. In the new design the specimen was held horizontally. It was therefore possible to determine the actual mass flow rate of abrasive abrading the specimen and consequently the number of particles in the contact zone and the load carried by each particle. The abrasive feed system was designed to improve control over the conditions in the contact region. The performance of the apparatus was evaluated in tests on low carbon (AISI 1020) steel, with wheels made from cast polyurethane and chlorobutyl rubber. The influences of load, sliding speed and rubber hardness were investigated. Temperature rises of wheel, specimen and sand, and the friction force were measured; the main mechanism of heat dissipation was through the continual flow of fresh abrasive past the specimen.},

@thesis{Triefenbach2008,
abstract = {The use of experiments in an effective way to analyze and optimize a given process is a problem statement which should be paid more attention to in the engineering community. Frequently, experiments are first performed and the measured data is analyzed afterwards. In contrast to this, statistical methods, like the concept of Design of Experiments, should be used to plan experimental designs and perform sets of well selected experiments to get the most informative combination out of the given fac- tors. Problem Statement: The Swedish company Umetrics AB is developing special software tools which deal with this field of statistical experimental design. Inside the software MODDE a feature for the creation of a special design type, the D-optimal de- sign, is given. The aim of the present thesis is the reimplementation of this program unit with improvements in the quality of the generated designs and the computational ef- fort. Approach: D-optimal designs are based on a computer-aided exchange procedure which creates the optimal set of experiments. An intensive literature study brings forth six different approaches to handle this exchange with a computer algorithm. In detail a comparison and evaluation of the Fedorov procedure, the modified Fedorov procedure, the DETMAX algorithm, the k-exchange algorithm, and the kl-exchange algorithm is performed. Based on this, a new algorithm, the modified kl-exchange algorithm, is devel- oped and used for the implementation in C++. Results: The outcome of the present thesis is an implementation of the four most advisable algorithms. The Fedorov and normal Fedorov algorithm generate the best designs considering the D-optimality of the designs but are very time-consuming for big data sets. As an alternative the k-exchange algorithm and a modified version of the kl-exchange algorithm are implemented to cre- ate comparable designs with a much higher computational efficiency. Conclusion: The new implementation of the D-optimal process creates designs which are at least com- parable to the old approach considering the quality or D-optimality of the designs. In addition to this, the computational efficiency, especially regarding big data sets with 10 and more factors, is higher. The selection of the adequate algorithm for the given problem formulation has to be performed by the user. As a future work, this process should be carried out to an automatic procedure based on a complexity analysis of the four implemented alternatives.},
